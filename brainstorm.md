### Task definition

Build an elevator control system

### Priorities 

1. Good interface that describe the system
2. State-oriented interaction (`Diode` looks like a good match here)
3. Elevators serving user requests logic 
4. Test coverage for that logic
5. GUI (`scala.js` over gh-pages proves to be a good choice)

Time-box myself for this task within 5 hours.
